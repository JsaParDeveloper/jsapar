title: Upgrading from JSaPar 1.x

<h2>Upgrading from version 1.x</h2>
The 2.0 version of the library differs fundamentally from the 1.x versions so there is no easy way to upgrade. This
article will however try to help as much as possible.
<div>
Almost all package names has changed in 2.0.
</div>
<h2>Converter</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The class <code>org.jsapar.io.Converter</code> is more or less replaced by <code>org.jsapar.Text2TextConverter</code></li>
    <li>It is no longer possible to get a list of errors as return value from the converter, instead use <code>org.jsapar.error.RecordingErrorEventListener</code> if you want to handle all errors when done parsing.</li>

</ul>

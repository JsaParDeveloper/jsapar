<h2>Java Schema Parser</h2>
The <a href="api/index.html">javadoc</a> contains more comprehensive documentation regarding the classes mentioned below. <br/><br/>
The JSaPar package is a java library that provides a parser for flat and CSV (Comma Separated Values) files. 
The concept is that a schema denotes the way a file should be parsed or composed. The schema instance to be used can be built by specifying a xml-document or it can be constructed programmatically by using java code.
The parser is event driven meaning that you need to provide an event handler while parsing. For convenience there are some
provided event handler or you may implement your own. For instance, the org.jsapar.parse.DocumentBuilderLineEventHandler
builds a  a org.jsapar.model.Document object that contains a list of org.jsapar.model.Line objects which contains a list
of org.jsapar.model.Cell objects. <br/> <br/>
Supported file formats:
<ul>
<li><b>Fixed width </b><i>- Also refered to as flat file. Each cell is described only by its positions within the line. </i></li>
<li><b>CSV </b><i>- (Comma Separated Values) Each cell is limited by a separator character (or characters).</i></li>
</ul>

<h2>Line types</h2>
Within the schema, you specify a number of line types. When parsing, the type of the line is either denoted by it's position
within the input or by a number of conditional cells. For one type of line you can for instance specify that the first cell
has a specific constant value. When composing, the line type is determined when you create the Line objects. When
converting from one format to another, the line type names of the input and the output schema needs to match.
<h2>Events for each line</h2>
For very large files there can be a problem to build the complete org.jsapar.model.Document in the memory before further processing.
It may simply take up to much memory. 
All parsers in this library requires that you provide an event handler that implements org.jsapar.parse.LineEventListener while parsing.
<p>
The JSaPar library contains some convenient implementations of the org.jsapar.parse.LineEventListener interface:
    <table>
    <tr><td><b>org.jsapar.parse.DocumentBuilderLineEventListener</b></td>
        <td>For smaller files you may want to handle all
        the events after the parsing is complete. In that case you may choose to use this implementation.
        That listener builds a org.jsapar.model.Document object containing all the parsed lines that you can iterate afterwards.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>org.jsapar.parse.MulticastLineEventListener</b></td>
        <td>If you need to handle the events in multiple event listener implementation, this implementation provides a
            way to register multiple line event listeners which are called one by one for each line event.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>org.jsapar.concurrent.ConcurrentLineEventListener</b></td>
        <td>This implementation separates the parsing thread from the consuming thread. It makes it possible for you to
            register a consumer line event listener that is called from a separate consumer thread.</td></tr>
</table>
</p>
<h2>Converting</h2>
<h3>Text to text</h3>
If you are only interesting in converting a file of one format into another, you can use the org.jsapar.Text2TextConverter where you specify the input and the output schema for the conversion.
The converter uses the event mechanism under the hood, thus it reads, converts and writes one line at a time.
This means it is very lean regarding memory usage. 
<h3>Text to Java beans</h3>
Use the org.jsapar.Text2BeanConverter in order to build java objects for each line in a file (or input).
Note that in order to be able to use this feature, the schema have to be carefully written. 
For instance, the line type (name) of the line within the schema have to contain the complete class name of the java class to build for each line. 
<h3>Java objects to text</h3>
Use the class Bean2TextConverter in order to convert java objects an output text file according to a schema.
<h3>Text to markup (XML or HTML)</h3>
Use the class Text2XmlConverter in order to produce a xml output. You can register a XSLT together with this converter and in
that way you convert the text to any other text output format such as HTML.
<h2>Using XML as input</h2>
It is possilbe to parse an xml document that conforms to the XMLDocumentFormat.xsd (http://jsapar.tigris.org/XMLDocumentFormat/1.0).
Use the class org.jsapar.XmlParser in order to parse an xml file and produce line parsed events.
<h2>Examples</h2>
The files for the examples below are provided in the <code>samples</code> folder of the project. The JUnit test <code>org.jsapar.JSaParExamplesTest.java</code>
contains a more comprehensive set of examples of how to use the package. 
<h3>Example of reading <b>CSV file</b> into a Document object according to an xml-schema:</h3>
<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge">
    <pre class="highlight">
        <code>
try(Reader schemaReader = new FileReader("samples/01_CsvSchema.xml");
    Reader fileReader = new FileReader("samples/01_Names.csv")){
   Xml2SchemaBuilder xmlBuilder = new Xml2SchemaBuilder();
   Parser parser = new Parser(xmlBuilder.build(schemaReader));
   Document document = parser.build(fileReader);
}
        </code>
    </pre>
</div>
<h3>Example of converting a <b>Fixed width file</b> into a <b>CSV file</b> according to two xml-schemas:</h3>
<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge">
    <pre class="highlight">
        <code>
try(Reader inSchemaReader = new FileReader("samples/01_CsvSchema.xml");
    Reader outSchemaReader = new FileReader("samples/02_FixedWidthSchema.xml")) {
    Xml2SchemaBuilder xmlBuilder = new Xml2SchemaBuilder();
    File outFile = new File("samples/02_Names_out.txt");
    try(Reader inReader = new FileReader("samples/01_Names.csv");
        Writer outWriter = new FileWriter(outFile)) {
        Converter converter = new Converter(xmlBuilder.build(inSchemaReader),
                                            xmlBuilder.build(outSchemaReader));
        converter.convert(inReader, outWriter);
    }
    Assert.assertTrue(outFile.isFile());
}
        </code>
    </pre>
</div>
<h3>Example of converting a <b>CSV file</b> into a list of <b>Java objects</b> according to an xml-schema:</h3>
<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge">
    <pre class="highlight">
        <code>
Reader schemaReader = new FileReader("samples/07_CsvSchemaToJava.xml");
Xml2SchemaBuilder xmlBuilder = new Xml2SchemaBuilder();
Reader fileReader = new FileReader("samples/07_Names.csv");
Parser parser = new Parser(xmlBuilder.build(schemaReader));
List&lt;CellParseError&gt; parseErrors = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;()
List&lt;TestPerson&gt; people = parser.buildJava(fileReader, parseErrors);
fileReader.close();</code>
    </pre>
</div>
If you want to run this example, you will need the class org.jsapar.TstPerson within your classpath. 
The class is not included in the jar file or in the binary package but it can be found in the source package. 
As an alternative you can create your own TstPerson class and modify the schema 07_CsvSchemaToJava.xml to use that class instead. 
The class should contain a default constructor plus getters and setters for all the attributes used in the schema.

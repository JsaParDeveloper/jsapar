 <title>Project Overview</title>

<p>JSaPar is a Java library with a schema based parser/producer of csv and flat files.
</p>

<p><b>This is a new project. Source and downloads will be available within a few days.
</b></p>


<h3>Mission</h3>

<p>The goal of this project is to create a java library that contains a parser of flat files and csv files. The parser should take a schema as input to denote how the file should be parsed.
</p>

<h3>Existing features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Support for flat files with fixed positions.</li>
<li>Support for CSV files.</li>
<li>The schema can be expressed with xml notation or created directly within the java code.</li>
<li>The output of the parser is a Document class containing a list of lines which contains a list of cells.</li>
<li>The Document class can be transformed into a Java object (via reflection) if the schema is carefully written.</li>
<li>The Document class can be transformed into a xml file (according to an internal xml schema).</li>
<li>The input and outputs are given by java.io.Reader and java.io.Writer which means that it is not necessarily files that are parsed or generated.</li>
<li>The file parsing schema contains information about how to parse each cell regarding data type and syntax.</li>
<li>Parsing errors can either be handled by exceptions thrown at first error or the errors can be collected during parsing to be able to deal with them later.</li>
<li>JUnit tests for most classes within the library.</li>
<li>Support for localisation.</li>
</ul>

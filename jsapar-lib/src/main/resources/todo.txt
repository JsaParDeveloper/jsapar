TODO for JsaPar 2.0 library:

Make a maven-jsapar-plugin to:
- validate the jsapar configuration file at build time
- validate the jsapar schema files at build time
- validate the jsapar annotations at build time
- generate xml files based on annotations (remember: xml overrules annotated classes!)
- generate xml mapping files based on the available jsapar schema's 
  (first create the jsapar schemata from xml and annotation, then use these jsaparschemata
   as input for the xml-mapper-creator-tool)
- validate the xml mapping files for correct mapping of jsapar schemata.
- Win the next Nobel Prize for feature-requester-of-the-year ;-)


- change xml-element in jsapar.cfg.xsd: exception-threshold --> error-threshold
- remove xml-element in jsapar.cfg.xsd: build-error-errorset

JSAPAR 2.0
==========

This project includes a root POM consisting of three projects:
* jsapar-lib
* jsapar-examples
* jsapar-constructionkit

The jsapar-examples project has a dependency on the jsapar-lib project, and is used to demonstrate the possibilities of the JsaPar library (jsapar-lib) in all of its glory. 

The jsapar-constructionkit project has a dependency on the jsapar-lib project, and is used to create JsaParSchema files visually.

To build the project using Maven2, just compile the project from the ROOT directory of the project.
For developing within the Eclipse IDE, just give the Maven2 "mvn eclipse:eclipse" command from the ROOT directory of the project.
Next import the three projects into your eclipse workspace.

That's all folks!
